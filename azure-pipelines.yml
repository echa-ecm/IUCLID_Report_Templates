# Starter pipeline
# Start with a minimal pipeline that you can customize to build and deploy your code.
# Add steps that build, run tests, deploy, and more:
# https://aka.ms/yaml

# specific path build
trigger:
  branches:
    include:
    - main
  paths:
    include:
    - IUCLID_Report_Templates/* # same as '/' for the repository root
    exclude:
    - README.md/*


jobs:
- job: Windows
  pool:
    vmImage: 'windows-latest'
  steps:
  - script: echo hello from Windows
  checkout: self  # self represents the repo where the initial Pipelines YAML file was found
  clean: true  # whether to fetch clean each time
  fetchDepth: 1  # the depth of commits to ask Git to fetch
  lfs: false  # whether to download Git-LFS files
  submodules: true | recursive  # set to 'true' for a single level of submodules or 'recursive' to get submodules of submodules
  path: C:\agent\_work\1\s\echa-ecm\IUCLID_Report_Templates  # path to check out source code, relative to the agent's build directory (e.g. \_work\1)
  persistCredentials: true  # set to 'true' to leave the OAuth token in the Git config after the initial fetch

pr:
- main
- releases/*
